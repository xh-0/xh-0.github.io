Dear readers,

Thank you for visiting my blog! I want to acknowledge that there aren't many posts in English here at the moment. As a native Chinese speaker, I've always written primarily in Chinese. However, I'm now working to translate my existing content into English to reach more readers.

This process involves using tools like Google Translate, so you may encounter occasional less-than-perfect expressions. I truly appreciate your understanding and patience as I navigate this transition.

The translation effort will take time, but I'm committed to bringing more content to you in English. Thank you for your support and for sticking around! :smile:
